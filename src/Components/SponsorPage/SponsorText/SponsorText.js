          In the times of crisis, children suffering from poverty are the ones
          most affected and face uncertain futures. Your monthly gift of 25â‚¬
          will help your sponsored child in gaining access to benefits like
          healthcare, life skills, education and job training before graduation.
          As a sponsor you will see your impact on the child through letters and
          photos from your child. You will know how you have helped the child
          when they need it the most.
